# London Chemistry Events

Welcome to London Chemistry Events!

We exist to connect the London Chemistry community. At the moment, we do this primarily through our Twitter account ([@LdnChemEvents](https://twitter.com/LdnChemEvents)). Here you will find a little about the project: Why?, What, The Small Print, and other bits and bobs.
